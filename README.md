- use linear regression model. if it works to simulate effects of "global warming" by modifying effect changes the linear model can also be used to demonstrate differences between states.
- simulation of climate zone temperature changes.
- Demonstrate the effect of using Lasso . Would allow for the "interpretability" of coefficients.
- Guide our analysis of simulation by using features with the highest coefficients.
- significance test of  consumption.  by region.
- run a statistical hypothesis test.  to  compare climate zones.
